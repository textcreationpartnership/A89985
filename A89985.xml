            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the Iesuits.</head>
            <p>IT is not yet full six weekes ago, since the seven Arch Iesuits, <hi>Abbot</hi> alias <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Wilmore</hi> alias <hi>Turnar, Iohn Hammond</hi> alias <hi>Iackson, Edmond Cannon,</hi> who stiled himselfe Bishop of <hi>Calcedon, Walter Coleman, Edmond Fryer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Wilford,</hi> were apprehended, convicted and condemned according to the Lawes of this Kingdome, provided in that behalfe for seducing and stealing away the hearts of his Majesties liege People from their obedience and lawfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Royall Crowne, and dignity, whose quarters had now hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the severall gates of the City, as an Embleme of their hatefull conspiracies, had not the Kings mercy, far above their deserts, at such a time when they could expect nothing in justice but a sudden and shamefull death, reprieved them from the gallowes, and gave them a longer time (if it bee possible for them so to doe) to see their erronious oppinions, but what good use doe they or the rest of their fellowes make of this, is it not rather an encouragement to them in their evill courses, surely it is to evidence the more clemency they receive from his Majesty, the more eagerly they labour to bring his Crowne in subjection to their holy Father the Pope, but let them know, forbearance is no quittance, they are still in the hands of Iustice, and an extraordinary see will set young Gregory a worke at any time.</p>
            <p>They being reprieved, two more came upon the stage, and acted their parts very bravely for a time, till at last they were forct to take their <hi>Exit</hi> at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</p>
            <p>Ones name was <hi>Andrew Roe,</hi> who upon his first apprehension was put in the Fleet, from whence some in the house soone perceiving his profession by the observation of his carriage) he was removed to Newgate, the fittest place of the two: The others name was <hi>Thomas Reynolds,</hi> who was taken at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber neere Turnestile, and bound over to answer for himselfe at the next Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which being come and both brought before the Bench to their tryall, one confest he had beene a Priest 30 yeares, the other that he had bin condemned for the same fact 12 yeares before in Surry.</p>
            <p>Both exprest themselves very willing to dye, saying they could not spend their blood in a more honourable cause; as for their Religion they were firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved to live and dye in it, being affured they should not lose their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but have their names canonized for Saints among Catholiques, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold by Angels in Heaven: whereupon the Recorder proceeded to give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of judgement upon them, which was, that they must bee carried from
<pb facs="tcp:112890:3"/> thence back againe to the place from whence they came, and from thence on Friday following be drawne on a Sledg to Tyburn, there to hang while their bodies were almost dead, then to be cut downe, dismembred, have their hearts and Bowels burnd, and after be divided in quarters, and their limbs left to the disposall of his Maiesty, which sentence was executed upon them Ian. 21. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse being there to heare some conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe late misfortunes that have lately befalne you have made us something afraid, and would much more afright us, but that we know (and all the rest of the Lords) have so good an Advocate as she is, that we make no question of your delivery, if that things fit rightly, but the base Commons are so bent, that nothing can be done, but they one way or other heare of it; yet for all their wits, the plot in <hi>Ireland</hi> goes on well, and though they be like <hi>Argus</hi> at home, yet they see but like a mole abroad. The comon People are so rude, that they are not ashamed to rayle against the good Queene, and I thinke that if they could, they would even pull her from her regall throne, but I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he doth suffer these things to be done, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his comming so long, but I thinke he will not procrastinate the matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long; for I had a letter from <hi>France</hi> he last weeke, which certified me that the King of <hi>France</hi> swore that he would not suffer these things to be done, though he lost his life. Likewise the good Mother Queene is in working (God
<pb facs="tcp:112890:4"/> and our holy Father assist her) such a work as willbe very wonderfull, if it come to passe. My Lord be close, and see the event. I hope to see you sit in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall of Ely, in as much state as ever you did, to curb the Puritans, one thing more, the Citizes of <hi>London</hi> make great provision for war, if occasion be, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every man and Apprentice hath a Musket, and other weapons, but wee feare them not; for they are not expert in using of them, but doe every thing in a disorder, that they one hinder another, but we have expert souldiers and Gentlemen, that are able to fight six to twenty of them, we have one thing more to certifie you of, that we are consulting together by what meanes wee may free you our of the Tower, and so you may escape beyond Sea and then fearing nothing, for his holinesse will protect you, and so my Lord, we commit you to God.</p>

            <p>THere have bin brought unto the place of execution, the Marquesse <hi>de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Reall,</hi> and his son, the Duke <hi>de Camucha;</hi> together with the Earle <hi>de Armamar,</hi> and <hi>Don Augustine Manuel;</hi> they were lodged that night at the house of <hi>Diego Duarta.</hi> Presently after, there was in the same night set up a Scaffold in the middest of the place of Execution, made with steps or degrees of Assent; upon the highest step there were set two Chaires, and made fast, one for the Duke, and the other for his Father: and on a lower there was set a thaire for the Earle of <hi>Armamar,</hi> and upon the boards lower, there was set ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaire for <hi>Don Augustine Manuel,</hi> so that they all did fit upon chaies or stooles, but one higher then the other. And there was made a Gallery for the

After that there were two high Gallowes set up; one at the side of S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> gate, and the other in the Street named <hi>Escudeiros,</hi> so that the Scaffold was in the midst‚ñ™ The next day betweene 11. and 12. of the clocke there came unto the windows of the house, foure Corrigidours of the Court, and some authorized Officers. Thereupon came the Marquesse <hi>de Villa Reall,</hi> with a Monteere upon his head, a little stick in his hand, and with a cloake about him. After that he had made the first step, he fell upon his knees, and made an elegant Speech, or lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with great constancy, more then was thought; then the Herauld at Armes began presently to cry, the King our Lord desireth, that right be done: <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Marquesse came, as I mentioned before upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, with great courage, and sate downe upon the chaire: then came the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, made his body and armes fast, and cut of his head; and presently the Marquesse was covered with a garment of Bayes. This being done, the Duke his son came forth, accompained as the Father; and the Herauld cryed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, untill the Duke came unto the chair, upon which his fathers body was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whose feet he kneeled downe (kissing the same a thousand times) and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved time, <hi>To say one Pater noster for his Fathers Soule.</hi> Which being done, he went unto his seat, but more faint-hearted, and so was beheaded, and covered. That came the Earle of <hi>Armamar,</hi> (with a common Doore-keeper) and <hi>Don Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Manuel,</hi> which were executed likewise. Besides <hi>Pero de Baessa</hi> and <hi>Belchior Correnda Franca,</hi> were hanged up at the side of S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> gate; and in the street nam'd <hi>Escudeiros,</hi> there hung <hi>Manuel Valente,</hi> and a Clerk; whereupon all the people began to part, and to cry, <hi>God save</hi> Don John, the Fourth.</p>
            <p>Thwo houres after the 4. hanged, were quartered, and their quarters carried away. But beleeve me, this relation, and spectacle following doth change my blood, <hi>viz.</hi> The two Bishops, and with them, the Bishop <hi>de Broga,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitior <hi>Mor,</hi> for the same Treason, are cast into the Tower of <hi>Belem,</hi> into deep pits, which run under the water, wherein there is no light, to end their lives there. The Bishop <hi>de Braga</hi> recanted not, but said to his last, that King <hi>Philip</hi> was his Lord, and that he did loose his life for him. The rest confessed their crimes, and alwayes cryed for the mercy of the King, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> the Fourth, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he Marques <hi>de Villa Reall,</hi> who had written 3. or 4 sheets of paper, craving his mercy: but the King had comitted it unto justice, and therefore would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in pardoning any of them. <hi>Beassa</hi> would confesse nothing, and dyed resolutely. Their intent was to kill the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> his Queen, his Son, and two Daughters, and to burne the Pallace and City upon one day.</p>
